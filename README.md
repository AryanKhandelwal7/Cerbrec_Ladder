__Installation__

1. Install Python packages:

  - Sign up at Anthropic
  - Get your API key
  - Replace the API key in the code with your own
4. Install Chrome browser (required for web scraping)

__Setup__

**Important**: You need to add your own Claude API key to make this work.

In the `info_scraper.py` file, find this line:
`CLAUDE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"`

Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual Claude API key from Anthropic.

__How to Use__

STEP 1. Find Player URLs
- Run the URL scraper: `python url_scraper.py`
- Enter a player name when prompted: `Enter player name: Jackson Smith`
- Wait for results - Takes 10-15 seconds per search
- Repeat for all players you want to search
- Results saved automatically to `player_urls.csv`

Step 2: Extract Player Information
- Run the info scraper: `python info_scraper.py`
- Script automatically processes all URLs from `player_urls.csv`
- Wait for AI extraction - Takes 3-5 seconds per player
- Final results saved to `scraped_players.csv`
